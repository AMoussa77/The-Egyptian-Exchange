# Quick Test Guide - Egyptian Exchange Announcements in Production

## 🚀 Quick Test Steps

### Option 1: Test Built Executable (Production Mode)

1. **Run the built executable:**
   ```
   dist\win-unpacked\Egyptian Exchange Stocks.exe
   ```
   OR
   ```
   dist\Egyptian Exchange Stocks-0.9.2-win-x64.exe
   ```

2. **Navigate to Announcements:**
   - Click on the "Announcements" or "إعلانات" tab
   - Click the "Refresh" button
   - Wait a few seconds

3. **Verify Announcements Load:**
   - You should see Egyptian Exchange announcements appear
   - They should have Arabic text with company codes like (XXX.CA)
   - Dates should be displayed correctly

### Option 2: Compare Dev vs Production

**Dev Mode (Should Already Work):**
```bash
npm run dev
```
- Check announcements tab ✅ Should work

**Production Mode (Now Fixed):**
```
dist\win-unpacked\Egyptian Exchange Stocks.exe
```
- Check announcements tab ✅ Should now work too!

## 🔍 What to Look For

### ✅ Success Indicators:
- Announcements tab shows real data from Mubasher.info
- Multiple announcements visible (usually 10-25 items)
- Arabic text with company codes like "قرار لجنة القيد بشأن شركة (EZZ.CA)"
- Dates show "X دقائق مضت" or actual dates
- No error messages in the announcements section

### ❌ If Still Not Working:
- Announcements show only 2-3 generic fallback messages
- Error messages appear in the announcements section
- "Failed to load announcements" message

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

If announcements still don't work in production:

1. **Check the Console** (Add --dev flag to see logs):
   ```
   "dist\win-unpacked\Egyptian Exchange Stocks.exe" --dev
   ```
   Look for these messages:
   - `✅ Axios loaded successfully for announcements scraper`
   - `🌐 Fetching announcements from Mubasher.info...`
   - `✅ Successfully scraped [X] announcements`

2. **Check Network Connection:**
   - Make sure you have internet access
   - Try opening https://www.mubasher.info/news/eg/now/announcements in a browser

3. **Verify Build:**
   - Make sure you ran `npm run build` after the fix
   - Check that `dist\win-unpacked\resources\app.asar.unpacked\node_modules\axios` exists
   - Check that `dist\win-unpacked\resources\axios` exists

4. **Force Rebuild:**
   ```bash
   # Clean old builds
   Remove-Item -Path "dist" -Recurse -Force
   
   # Rebuild
   npm run build
   
   # Test
   .\dist\win-unpacked\Egyptian Exchange Stocks.exe
   ```

## 📊 Expected Console Output

When working correctly in production, you should see:

```
✅ Axios loaded successfully for announcements scraper
OR
Failed to load axios for announcements scraper: Cannot find module 'axios'
Failed to load axios for announcements from extraResources: ...
Failed to load axios for announcements from asar unpacked: ...
✅ Using Node.js built-in HTTP module as axios fallback for announcements

📡 Response data length: 45087

## 🎯 Key Difference from Before

**Before Fix:**
```
⚠️ Axios not available for announcements
📰 Returning fallback announcements data
[Only shows 2-3 generic fallback messages]
```

**After Fix:**
```
✅ Using Node.js built-in HTTP module as axios fallback
📡 Response status: 200
✅ Successfully scraped 15 announcements
[Shows real announcements from Mubasher.info]
```

## 💡 Important Notes

1. **Dev mode** (`npm run dev`) loads axios from `node_modules` - always works
2. **Production mode** (built .exe) needs fallback mechanisms - now fixed
3. The fix uses the same approach as the live data scraper (which already works)
4. Multiple fallback paths ensure announcements always load

## ✅ Verification Complete When:

- [x] Built new production version (`npm run build`)
- [ ] Tested production .exe file
- [ ] Announcements load successfully in production
- [ ] Real data appears (not just fallback messages)
- [ ] Both dev and production modes work identically
